            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>My hobbies bring me joy and balance in life. 
                I love playing volleyball because it keeps me active and teaches teamwork, 
                while writing allows me to express my thoughts and creativity. 
                I enjoy listening to music and reading, as they help me relax and discover new ideas. 
                In my free time, I also like cooking and eating, which let me explore different flavors 
                and cultures. Lastly, travelling is one of my favorite hobbies because it gives me the 
                chance to experience new places, spend time with my family, meet people, 
                and learn more about the world. I also love playing COD especially using snipere since 
                it enhances my scoping ability and can also help me exercise fingers.</p>

            <h2>Details</h2>
            <p>I like these hobbies because they make my life more enjoyable and meaningful. 
                Volleyball keeps me active and lets me bond with friends, while writing gives me
                 a way to express my feelings and ideas. Listening to music and reading help me relax 
                 and inspire me to think in new ways. I started enjoying cooking and eating when 
                 I was younger at home, and over time it became something I truly love. My passion 
                 for travelling began when I had the chance to visit new places, and since then I have 
                 enjoyed discovering cultures and learning from new experiences. I started playing COD when a 
                 friend of mine invited me to join them, way back 2021, and I really enjoyed it a lot. 
                 Starting that day, we play and play which came to the point that we entered a tournament and we 
                 actually won as champions</p>

        <h3>Fun Fact</h3>
        <p>Did you know that playing volleyball for just one hour can burn up to 300â€“400 calories, 
            making it both fun and a great workout? Also, studies show that listening to music can 
            improve memory and reduce stress, while reading regularly helps increase empathy and vocabulary. 
            Cooking and eating together can strengthen relationships, and travelling has been proven to 
            boost happiness by giving people exciting new experiences.</p>
